PlateShare is a web application that provides its users with a one place solves all solution, that not only tackles a user trying to browse recipes, but also creators who want to share their recipes. 
Additionally, we value the privacy of our users greatly and require authentication each time a new or returning user attempts to log in. We've also included a few innovative and fresh features to enhance the user experience. For instance, our menu bar is a simplistic action design where the menu expands out to allow the user to interact with it without having to continuously click on a bothersome, stationary bar.

•	“PlateShare” is built using Express.js, Node.js framework that handles HTTP requests, middleware, and routing. Express-session and connect-MySQL are being used here for the user authentication steps.

•	Bcrypt is used to check (hashing) on the password verification step, and in case of attack on the database acts as a safety net.

•	MySQL2 is also used for database communication.

•	Multer is used to make sure the file uploads are efficient and accurate without any difficulties.

•	Route handling done allows proper consistent communication with the database and creates a type of seamless user authentication experience as well as good content management.

The database of PlateShare is well structured to manage user information, recipes along with ingredients and instruction steps. This design is what allows the applications proper functionality making the usability and user-experience smooth and efficient.
